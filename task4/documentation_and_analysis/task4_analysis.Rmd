# Cleaning

Oh, boy.

## First steps

The three sheets are all organised and labelled differently, on top of having different questions, so the first thing I need to do is find commonalities to unify across.

I figured a good place to start was to import the three sheets, run `clean_names()` from `janitor` across them, export the column names as 3 vectors and just see if there was immediately any columns in column. I expected 2015 and 2016 might, but I wasn't expecting much like with 2017, as the headers have been formatted more cleanly.

I did this using `intersect()` in a form similar to this
```{r eval=FALSE}
intersect(intersect(2015data,2016data),2017data)
```
Unsurprisingly, I got nothing back. Intersecting just 2015 and 2016 returned 93 columns though, which is encouraging!

At this point, it makes the most sense to me to work on joining 2015 and 2016, then bring the combined might to bear on 2017.
